# Corona Tracker (Covid-19)
> An app that tracks covid-19 data 

## Usage 

- A React app which shows us worldwide corona-virus statistics. 
- We fetched the data from _mathdro.id_ website with **axios**.
- Our app shows the infected, recovered and death numbers of COVID-19 worldwide. 
- Gives us interactive looks with chart. We used **Chart.js** for interactive chart design. 
- We can select countries and see the statistics of that country.
